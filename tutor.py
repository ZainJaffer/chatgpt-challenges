# # Exercise 6: List Length
# # Create a list of your top 3 favorite movies. Use the `len()` function to print the number of items in the list.

# Exercise 8: Getting User Input
# Ask the user to input their age using the `input()` function. Convert the input to an integer and print it.

# user_age = int(input("What is your age"))

# user_age = int(input("What is your age"))
# print(user_age)
# print(type(user_age))

# Exercise 9: List and Sum Function
# Create a list of 5 numbers. Use the `sum()` function to calculate and print the sum of the numbers in the list.

list_num = [2,3,4,5,6]

print(sum(list_num))

# Exercise 10: Boolean Variables
# Create two boolean variables, one representing that the light is on and another that the door is closed. Use `print()` to display their values.

light_on = True
door_on = False
